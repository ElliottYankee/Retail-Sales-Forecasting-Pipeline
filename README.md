# Retail-Sales-Forecasting-Pipeline
An automated time series retail sales forecasting model with an ETL pipeline

## Overview
An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts retail sales using time series analysis. This project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion to model deployment, featuring automated ETL pipelines, multiple forecasting models, and a production-ready API.

## Business Problem
Accurate sales forecasting is critical for:
- Inventory Management: Preventing stockouts and overstock situations
- Resource Planning: Optimizing staff scheduling and warehouse operations
- Financial Planning: Improving revenue predictions and budget allocation
- Marketing Strategy: Timing promotions and campaigns effectively

## Future Features
- Automated ETL Pipeline: Processes raw sales data with validation and error handling
- Feature Engineering: Creates time-based, lag, and trend features for improved predictions
- Multi-Model Framework: Compares Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- REST API: Provides real-time predictions via FastAPI
- Containerization: Docker support for easy deployment
- Monitoring: Tracks model performance and data quality over time
- Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests for all pipeline components

## Dataset
This project will use retail sales data featuring:
- Time Series Data: Daily sales records over multiple years
- Product Categories: Sales across different product lines
- Store Information: Multiple store locations and characteristics
- External Factors: Holidays, promotions, and seasonal events
